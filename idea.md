1. Core Gameplay Concept
Storyline and Theme: Imagine a whimsical world where misinformation has corrupted nature. Our hero—a resourceful, chubby bear—is on a quest to restore truth and knowledge. The bear faces off against creatures representing outdated or erroneous ideas (for example, a battle-hungry T-Rex symbolizing a crumbling old narrative). Along the journey, mystical items sprinkled throughout the levels unlock secrets of science, history, literature, and more.

Shooting Mechanic: The shooter element isn’t about violence but about “clearing away” confusion and unlocking educational power-ups. Each enemy defeated can trigger a brief fun fact related to the subject area—perhaps debunking a myth or presenting a cool science fact in a playful way.

Mystical Items: Items like glowing orbs, ancient scrolls, or enchanted books serve as interactive tokens. When the bear touches these items, a pop-up appears with a fun fact, an educational puzzle, or a mini-game. This reinforces learning at the exact moment of action, making the educational content feel rewarding and well-integrated.

2. Tailoring Content for Different Age Groups
For Small Kids:

Visuals: Use bright, colorful graphics and charming character designs that are instantly appealing.

Content: Focus on simple, concrete facts. For example, facts about animals and nature (“Did you know bears have an excellent sense of smell?”) or basic science principles (colors, shapes, simple cause-and-effect).

Interactivity: Include simple touch or click interactions for the mystical items—maybe a tap generates an animated demonstration related to the fact.

Narration and Audio: Consider incorporating friendly voiceovers that read out the fun facts for kids who are just learning to read.

For Teenage Users:

Visuals: Maintain a polished, engaging aesthetic with slightly more detailed character models and immersive environments.

Content: Dive into more in-depth topics such as historical milestones, advanced science, environmental issues, or tech innovations. For instance, defeating the misinformation enemies might unlock facts about how climate change has impacted species or how technological advances have shaped society.

Interactivity: Implement multi-step puzzles or mini-quests that require critical thinking. The game might even feature a “choose your own adventure” style where decisions impact the educational outcome.

Challenge Levels: Include bonus levels or boss fights that require using the learning—solving puzzles mid-combat, for example—to advance, reinforcing logical reasoning and strategic planning.

3. Integration of Educational Elements
Fact Pop-ups and Mini-lessons: Whenever the bear collects a mystical item, you can trigger a short animated sequence or pop-up that briefly explains a fun fact, poses a question, or provides a puzzle. This could be on-screen text, interactive diagrams, or even a short narrated clip.

Quiz/Challenge Modes: At the end of each level or as bonus content, challenge players with a quiz that tests what they learned. Correct answers could unlock special abilities or narrative rewards, seamlessly combining gameplay with assessment.

Thematic Levels: Design levels around specific themes. For example, one level might be set in a prehistoric environment where the bear learns about evolution and extinct creatures, while another could be in a futuristic city discussing technological innovations.

4. Game Mechanics and Balancing
Shooting Mechanics with a Twist: Instead of just eliminating enemies, you could have a mechanic where “shooting” a target temporarily “activates” it, allowing players to trigger an informational sequence. Think of it as a way to “reprogram” misinformation into solid, verifiable fact.

Movement and Aiming: The character’s movement (perhaps following the mouse pointer for fluidity) can serve both as navigation and targeting. For example, precise targeting might be rewarded by more in-depth educational content, encouraging players to pay attention and engage actively.

Progression and Rewards: As players progress, gradually introduce more complex concepts. Rewards can include unlocking new abilities or power-ups that tie directly to the topics learned (like a “Wisdom Boost” that temporarily highlights hidden clues in the level).

5. Overall Tone and Concept
Edutainment Balance: The key is balancing action with education. Ensure that the shooter mechanics are engaging enough to keep the pace exciting while not overshadowing the educational snippets.

Narrative Voice: Use a playful narrative tone—perhaps the bear is a quirky, knowledgeable mentor figure in itself. The game’s dialogue can be light-hearted yet informative, appealing to both younger audiences and teenagers.

Final Thoughts
Both small kids and teenagers can enjoy learning through gameplay, but the design must be tailored to their cognitive levels:

Kids benefit from highly engaging, simple, and visually stimulating content with immediate rewards.

Teenagers enjoy layering information with strategic, complex challenges that provoke curiosity and deeper thought.
