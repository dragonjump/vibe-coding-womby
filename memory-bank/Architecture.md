# Rocket Hamster Adventure - Technical Architecture

## 1. System Overview
The game is a client-side 3D web application built with Three.js and related technologies. The architecture follows a modular pattern with clear separation of concerns between different systems.

## 2. Client-Side Architecture

### 2.1 Core Systems
- **Rendering Engine**: Three.js with WebGL renderer
- **Physics Engine**: Cannon.js integrated with the rendering engine
- **Audio System**: Howler.js for sound effects and background music
- **Input System**: Handles keyboard, mouse, and touch inputs
- **State Management**: Redux for global game state


### 2.2 Module Structure
src/
├── assets/            # Game assets (models, textures, sounds)
├── entities/          # Game entities (hamster, obstacles, collectibles)
├── systems/           # Core systems (physics, rendering, audio)
├── scenes/            # Game scenes (menu, gameplay, gameover)
├── components/        # UI components
├── utils/             # Utility functions and helpers
└── main.js            # Entry point


### 2.3 Key Components
- **Game Loop**: Central loop handling updates and rendering
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: For managing game objects
- **Resource Manager**: Handles asset loading and caching
- **Collision Handler**: Processes physics collisions

## 3. Physics Architecture
- **World**: Single physics world instance
- **Bodies**: Dynamic bodies for hamster, static bodies for terrain
- **Constraints**: For attaching rocket pack to hamster
- **Collision Groups**: Different groups for player, world, collectibles

## 4. Rendering Pipeline
1. **Scene Setup**: Initialize Three.js scene, camera, renderer
2. **Lighting**: Ambient, directional, and point lights
3. **Post-Processing**: Effects like bloom, motion blur
4. **LOD System**: Level-of-detail management for distant objects

## 5. State Management
- **Global State**: Player position, inventory, game progress
- **Local State**: UI components, temporary data
- **Reducers**: Handle state transitions based on actions

## 6. Audio Architecture
- **Sound Effects**: Played on specific events (collecting cheese, boosting)
- **Background Music**: Looping tracks with dynamic volume
- **Spatial Audio**: For 3D positional sounds

## 7. Input Handling
- **Keyboard**: Movement controls, actions
- **Mouse**: Camera control, targeting
- **Touch**: Mobile controls (virtual joystick, buttons)

## 8. Data Flow
1. User input → Input System → Game State Update
2. Game State → Physics System → Entity Updates
3. Entity Updates → Rendering System → Frame Render
4. Collisions → Game Logic → State Changes

## 9. Performance Optimization
- **Object Pooling**: For reusable game objects
- **Frustum Culling**: Only render visible objects
- **Web Workers**: Offload heavy computations
- **Memory Management**: Track and minimize garbage collection

## 10. Security Considerations
- **Input Sanitization**: For any user-generated content
- **CORS**: Proper configuration for asset loading
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrict unsafe eval and inline scripts

## 11. Deployment Architecture
- **Build Pipeline**: Webpack for bundling and optimization
- **Hosting**: Static site host with CDN for assets
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking and performance metrics

## 12. Future Expansion Points
- **Multiplayer**: Socket.io integration for real-time communication
- **Level Editor**: Separate module for user-generated content
- **Procedural Generation**: System for random level creation

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the game while allowing for future expansion and maintenance. Each system is designed to be modular and testable, ensuring stability as features are added.

# Project Architecture Updates

## Current File Structure
```
/
├── index.html         # Main entry point, handles canvas and Three.js setup
├── main.js           # Game initialization and main loop
└── memory-bank/      # Documentation and planning
    ├── Progress.md   # Implementation progress tracking
    └── Architecture.md # Technical documentation
```

## File Purposes

### index.html
- Serves as the entry point for the game
- Handles viewport configuration for responsive design
- Sets up full-screen canvas element
- Loads Three.js from CDN for rapid development
- Contains minimal CSS for fullscreen display

### main.js
- Will handle game initialization
- Will contain main game loop
- Will manage Three.js scene setup
- Will handle input processing
- Will coordinate game state

### Documentation (/memory-bank)
- Progress.md: Tracks implementation status and next steps
- Architecture.md: Documents technical decisions and structure
- Implementation Plan.md: Details development roadmap
- Game Design Document.md: Defines game mechanics and features
- Tech Stack.md: Lists technologies and dependencies

## Technical Decisions
1. Using CDN instead of npm for rapid prototyping
2. Single JavaScript file structure for quick iteration
3. Inline CSS for minimal setup time
4. Canvas-based rendering for optimal WebGL support

## Next Architectural Considerations
- Scene graph organization
- Game state management
- Input handling system
- Physics implementation approach
