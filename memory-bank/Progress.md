# Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Quick Setup
### Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Created basic project structure
- Set up index.html with:
  - Viewport configuration
  - Full-screen canvas setup
  - Three.js CDN integration (r128)
  - Basic CSS for fullscreen display
- Created placeholder main.js file
- Used CDN approach instead of npm for rapid development
- Set up responsive canvas sizing

### Step 2: Basic Structure (Completed)
- Implemented Three.js scene setup with:
  - Scene initialization with sky blue background
  - PerspectiveCamera configuration (75Â° FOV)
  - WebGL renderer with antialiasing
  - Responsive window resize handling
- Added basic lighting:
  - Ambient light (50% intensity)
  - Directional light (80% intensity)
- Implemented game loop with:
  - Delta time calculation
  - Proper animation frame handling
  - Performance optimization for pixel ratio
- Added atmospheric elements:
  - Multi-layered cloud system
  - Dynamic cloud movement
  - Varied cloud sizes and positions

### Step 3: Basic Character (Completed)
- Created simple hamster model with:
  - Spherical body and head
  - Cone-shaped ears
  - Box-shaped rocket pack
  - Brown color scheme
- Implemented basic controls:
  - WASD for movement
  - Spacebar for jumping
  - Gravity and ground collision
- Added camera following:
  - Smooth camera tracking
  - Proper viewing angle
  - Height offset for better visibility

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 4: Core Gameplay
- Need to implement rocket boost mechanics
- Need to add seed shooting system
- Need to create basic collectibles

### Testing Notes
- Character responds to WASD controls
- Jump mechanics working with gravity
- Camera follows character smoothly
- Basic collision with ground implemented
