# Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Quick Setup
### Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Created basic project structure
- Set up index.html with:
  - Viewport configuration
  - Full-screen canvas setup
  - Three.js CDN integration (r128)
  - Basic CSS for fullscreen display
- Created placeholder main.js file
- Used CDN approach instead of npm for rapid development
- Set up responsive canvas sizing

### Step 2: Basic Structure (Completed)
- Implemented Three.js scene setup with:
  - Scene initialization with sky blue background
  - PerspectiveCamera configuration (75Â° FOV)
  - WebGL renderer with antialiasing
  - Responsive window resize handling
- Added basic lighting:
  - Ambient light (50% intensity)
  - Directional light (80% intensity)
- Implemented game loop with:
  - Delta time calculation
  - Proper animation frame handling
  - Performance optimization for pixel ratio
- Added atmospheric elements:
  - Multi-layered cloud system
  - Dynamic cloud movement
  - Varied cloud sizes and positions

### Step 3: Basic Character (Completed)
- Created simple hamster model with:
  - Spherical body and head
  - Cone-shaped ears
  - Box-shaped rocket pack
  - Brown color scheme
- Implemented basic controls:
  - WASD for movement
  - Spacebar for jumping
  - Gravity and ground collision
- Added camera following:
  - Smooth camera tracking
  - Proper viewing angle
  - Height offset for better visibility

### Step 4: Core Gameplay (Completed)
- Implemented rocket boost mechanics:
  - Shift key activation
  - Fuel system with regeneration
  - Visual particle effects
  - Exhaust point tracking
- Added seed shooting system:
  - Left click to shoot
  - Ballistic trajectory
  - Automatic seed regeneration
  - Camera-based targeting
- Created particle effects system:
  - Rocket exhaust particles
  - Particle lifetime and fading
  - Physics-based movement
  - Memory-efficient cleanup

### Step 5: Basic Level Elements (Completed)
- Added collectible system:
  - Glowing golden seeds
  - Floating animation
  - Collection particles
  - Seed reward (+3 seeds)
  - Score reward (+100 points)
- Implemented obstacles:
  - Red barrier towers
  - Collision detection
  - Physics-based pushback
  - Strategic placement
- Created UI elements:
  - Score display
  - Fuel meter
  - Seed counter
  - Clean, readable design
- Added level initialization:
  - Circular seed pattern
  - Four corner obstacles
  - Memory management
  - Easy reset capability

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 6: Polish and Feel
- Need to add sound effects
- Need to implement visual feedback
- Need to add game state management

### Testing Notes
- Character responds to WASD controls
- Jump mechanics working with gravity
- Camera follows character smoothly
- Basic collision with ground implemented
- Rocket boost activates with Shift
- Seed shooting works with left click
- Particle effects visible and performing well
- Collectibles can be gathered
- Obstacles provide proper collision
- UI elements update correctly
